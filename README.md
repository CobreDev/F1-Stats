#  F1 Stats
A (very) basic app that tracks Formula One teams and drivers from the current season

### To Do:
• Add live data, currently everything is just hardcoded. Probably going to use [Ergast](http://ergast.com/mrd)
• Dynamically update year so that it's not static
• Create an icon
• Use Formula One font
• ...
• Widgets?
• Beautiful-er UI?

### Notes:
Drivers.json is a copy of the API JSON file from ergast
